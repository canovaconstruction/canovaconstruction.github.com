After completing construction of a new home for the CFO of F.W. Webb, Canova Construction moved into the development of industrial facilities for the Webb companies. It was in this corporate world of budget and time restraints that Joe learned how to successfully manage large construction projects. Later the direction of the company changed its focus to building and remodeling residential homes in the North shore area. Today we are a small company with the ability to give a high degree of individual attention to every project.
