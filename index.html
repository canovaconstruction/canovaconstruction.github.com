        <p>Joseph Canova started Canova Construction in 1982 and the business primarily
        dealt with the renovation of investment properties and building spec houses.
        After completing construction of a new home for the CFO of F.W. Webb, Canova
        Construction moved into the development of industrial facilities for the Webb
        companies. It was in this corporate world of budget and time restraints that Joe
        learned how to successfully manage large construction projects. Later the
        direction of the company changed its focus to building and remodeling residential
        homes in the North shore area.</p>

        <p>Today we are a small company with the ability to give a high degree of
        individual attention to every project. We specialize in small home construction
        as well as complete home renovation-to include condominium renovations as well as
        additions.</p>
