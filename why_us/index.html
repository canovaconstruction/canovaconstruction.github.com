              <p>We work with architects and designers to identify any hidden or
              over-looked costs, ensuring homeowners have accurate and valuable
              information resulting in projects being brought in on time and on budget.
              No matter what your building needs you can rely on us to provide you with
              insightful ideas and helpful solutions.</p>

              <h2>Sub Contractors</h2>
              <hr />

              <p>General Contractors employ sub contractors in order to remain
              competitive. Few companies can afford a full time staff of all the
              tradesmen necessary to complete a project. Therefore, a construction
              company is only as good as the sub contractors it employs. At Canova
              Construction our sub contractors have been with us as long as 20 years. We
              are a family of craftsmen that depend on each other to complete their part
              of the work in a timely and professional manner so that we all can enjoy
              continued success.</p>

              alt="Tape" />

              <p>We hand select all our lumber choosing the best framing and finishing
              materials available. We often use a higher grade lumber than what is called
              for. We nail, screw and glue what is beyond expected to ensure a projects
              longevity.</p>

              <h2>Estimation</h2>
              <hr />

              <p>In estimating a renovation project there is no x-ray vision for what
              lies behind the walls and under the floors, but experience is a guide into
              what we may encounter. We inform all our customers about these potentially
              latent conditions in an effort to avoid unforeseen costs. We inform all our
              customers of any unfavorable structural or mechanical conditions that may
              develop during the course of remodeling that have not been previously
              discussed. In most instances, fixing these problems at our cost.</p><br />

              <h2>Protection</h2>
              <hr />

              <p>We protect floors using &frac14; hardboard, lighting
              fixtures and valuables that need to remain during renovations in custom
              made plywood boxes, and contain dust with plastic tents. No matter what the
              project we allow for time at the end of every day to clean and make sure
              all debris are contained.</p>

              <h2>Cost</h2>
              <hr />

              "225" alt="House" />

              <p>Homeowners pricing renovations generally receive a broader range in
              costs than in new construction. General contractors who don't have
              confidence in this field often times either over or under estimate the
              amount of time required to complete the project, resulting in a price that
              is to high or to low to adequately finish. New construction is generally
              priced by the square foot and while that number varies most contractors are
              aware of the current costs which results in bids much closer to the actual
              costs.</p>

              <p>When you contract with Canova Construction you'll receive a detailed
              proposal and an itemized Schedule of Values (AIA Document) which breaks
              down the contract price into the many different phases of construction and
              assigns a cost value to each so you pay and get credited as the job
              progresses. This eliminates the need for large unsecured payments.</p>

              <p>Changes of Work Orders (AIA Document) are used to put into writing the
              changes and the costs associated with those changes. These changes can
              either increase or decrease the scope and cost of the job. We make every
              effort to be up front and honest by reviewing material and labor costs in
              advance of the changes. We minimize the financial impact on you in the
              event of an increase, or fairly rebate you in the case of a decrease.</p>
